    What distinguishes a great school from a good school? I believe that clarity of purpose, exceptional teachers, and demonstrated outcomes are hallmarks of great schools. A great school is a place with a deep commitment to student learning, where faculty nourish the intellectual, moral, emotional, and social growth of every student. It is a place where students, teachers, and parents embark together on an academic journey with clear and well-defined objectives. It is filled with the joy of discovery and the excitement of personal challenge and growth. It is a community dedicated to developing strength of character and excellence in all dimensions of its students' lives. And it is a place that has a distinctive and lasting impact.
<br>
    The Srikasyap School strives to be a great school. Our mission, simply put, is to prepare students for lives of purpose, achievement, and generosity of spirit. The three dynamic women who founded our school set out with this mission in 1904, and it continues to guide everything that we do.

    As a connected K-12 learning community, Potomac offers many exciting advantages. Just three miles from the rich resources of the nation's capital, our modern campus is situated on 90 beautiful, wooded acres. Our talented faculty are experts in their disciplines with a deep commitment to student success; they truly get to know each child, providing the challenge, support, and encouragement that fosters learning and personal growth. Our rigorous program of inquiry and study empowers students to exercise their intellectual curiosity, expand their understanding, and develop critical skills for future success. And our emphasis on character and values challenges each student to be a person of integrity, a contributing member of our school community, and a thoughtful and involved citizen of the world.
